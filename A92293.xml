            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS To Augment the Number of Hackney Coaches, Within the BILLS OF MORTALITY, FROM <hi>Four Hundred to Six or Eight Hundred:</hi> Most humbly tendred to The <hi>CONSIDERATION</hi> of BOTH Houses of Parliament.</head>
            <p>THAT if Four Hundred <hi>Hackney Coaches</hi> were a fit Number, when the Statute was made, then Six Hundred at least will be now required. For the vast increase of Building since 1662, is obvious to every Eye, and that the Inhabitants are ptoportionably increased, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the <hi>Bills</hi> of <hi>Mortality,</hi> being now a Third more than in 1662.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT it is most certain that Eight Hundred under due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation, as to Method, Order, and Station, which never yet was done, would less incommode the <hi>Town,</hi> than Four Hundred left to themselves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THAT whereas it is pretended there are but One hundred and thirty besides the Four H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>dred that now drive, and that the <hi>Streets</hi> are so crouded, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> can scarce pass. The truth is, that there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> within the <hi>Bills</hi> of <hi>Mortality</hi> above
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150213:2"/>a Thousand <hi>Hackney Coaches</hi> in constant Employ, as is ready to be made appear.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THAT from that Extravagant Number, under no Rules of Order, the <hi>Ways</hi> are indeed pester'd, and the Freedom of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage and Intercourse much obstructed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THAT these very Persons, who fear to be ruin'd if Six or Eight Hundred be allowed, do now keep on Foot the said exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Number of <hi>Hackney Coaches,</hi> many of them having Three, Four, Five, or Six <hi>Coaches</hi> a-piece.</p>
            <p n="6">6. THAT the said Persons since the <hi>Act</hi> expir'd, have by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination, and by Bribes, and Corruption in the last Reign; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Pretence of those Licences, that indeed expir'd with the <hi>Act,</hi> kept up a sort of <hi>Monopoly</hi> of <hi>Hackney Coaches,</hi> excluding all but themselves (tho all when the <hi>Act</hi> expir'd, had equal Right) forcing them to desist by Unjust and Vexatious Suits; which the Poverty of those they oppressed could not oppose.</p>
            <p n="7">7. THAT it is most plain, that the formerly Licensed Four Hundred have regard not to the Publick Convenience, but their Private Gain; by this Endeavour of theirs to continue a <hi>Monopoly</hi> to themselves only, though too few to serve; and exclude a moderate Number of others, when all might live by it, and the Publick be better served.</p>
            <p n="8">8. THAT many, if not most of the formerly Licensed Four Hundred are not Driving <hi>Coach-Men,</hi> but such as Lett out their Licences at great Extortion to <hi>Poor Men,</hi> themselves not keeping either <hi>Coach</hi> or <hi>Horse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. THAT there are, beside the formerly licensed, Three or Four Hundred Ancient Driving <hi>Hackney Coach-men</hi> about the <hi>Town, Men</hi> fitly qualified for that Employment, as having used it, some Forty, some Fifty Years, most of them Twenty and Thirty Years, and scarce fit for other Business; who with their Families may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably fall to the Parish, if not let in by <hi>an Act,</hi> enlarging the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Hackney Coaches.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:150213:2"/>
            <p n="10">10. THAT since Rules and Orders prescribed to <hi>Coaches,</hi> may easily prevent Quarrels and Stops, and since the Inlargment of the <hi>Town,</hi> and increase of the <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> require for Publick Convenience, a greater Number of such <hi>Coaches;</hi> since there are Two Hundred Persons fitly qualified, whom it is great Charity to admit; and since there is nothing opposed to all these just Motives and Inducements for an Augmentation of the Number of <hi>Hackney Coaches</hi> by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> except only a few specious Pretences, colouring (in Prejudice of the Publick Benefit) the Private Interest of the formerly Licensed Four Hundred, who it is well known were not able to supply those vast multitudes of People inhabiting in and about the Town after the Restraint made in the late Reign by the <hi>Popish Commission,</hi> as may appear by the many Complaints then made. It is therefore most humbly hoped and prayed, That the <hi>Parliament</hi> will increase the Number of <hi>Hackney Coaches,</hi> to Six or Eight Hundred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All which is most humbly submitted to the</hi> Wisdom <hi>and</hi> Justice <hi>of the</hi> PARLIAMENT.</p>
